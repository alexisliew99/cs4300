# Homework 2: Introduction to Django
Title: My Cinema Web Application
Author: Alexis Liew
Date: October 7, 2025

## Setup Instructions
In this application, I did not use DevEdu to access my application.
I did the same method just like Homework#1
    1. Run Docker 
    2. Run this http://localhost/ on web browser
    3. Create a new terminal and enter these lines of code.

    'cd cs4300/homework2'
    'source alexis_ven/bin/activate'
    'python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:3000' (Note: this will open the web application)

    You should now be able to use the application. Please login with the test user that I have created for testing and grading purposes. The login credentials are as follows:

    Username:alexis123
    Password:123

## AI Usage
ChatGPT was utilized to generate code for certain sections of this project. AI-generated code was used to complete parts 3.3, 3.4 and 3.6 of the assignment, as well as for general debugging. The code for the HTML templates was taken directly from ChatGPT given my time constraints, however most of the AI-generated content was used for reference.
